# Calvin's "Playground" Project

Library of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. Main purpose is educational
This is where I play and learn different kind of algorithms, data structures, concepts, techniques, etc. Anything related to Programming. Most of the problems included are basics for now which I personally find important. I plan to continue contributing more problems here for the future.
