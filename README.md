# Calvin's "Playground" Project [![CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/stalk-calvin/Python-Algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stalk-calvin/Python-Algorithms)

Library of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python language. I created this repository for educational purpose, mainly for myself. This is where I play and learn different kind of algorithms, data structures, concepts, techniques, etc in Python. Most of the problems included are basics for now which I personally find them important. I plan to continue contributing more problems here in the future.
